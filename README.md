cndorphbot
==========
*a pet bot.*

This repository is mostly here for my personal reference and version control.
But, for the curious, the main guts of the bot behavior are under
`cndorphbot.py`, and its language module is `chatter.py`.

Please don't bother with opening issues in this repo; I currently do not have
the resources to manage public commentary or suggestions for this codebase.

If you found this repo because you are interacting with this bot somewhere and
you think it's misbehaving, please contact me through that medium specifically,
so that I'm best able to address that issue.
